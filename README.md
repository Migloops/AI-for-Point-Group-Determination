# PGdet: Determination of symmetry pointgroup from a SMILES organic molecule

PGdet is a school project created by students of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne: Aldric Mercier, Alexandre Keller and Miguel Correia. The aim of this code is to take organic molecules written in SMILES and extract their pointgroup.


## 1. Installation
PGdet relies on NumPy, pointgroup and RDKIT.
